# Interpretable Neural Networks
Work on Interpretable Neural Networks based on IAIA_BL thesis for the summer of 2023 research project - with Professor Luk Wayne.
Contains code for training and testing an interpretable model that consist of a BlackBox NN, followed by prototype layer that 
calculates distance between prototypes and convoltional features. The final fully connected layer gives the output logits.

Note:- Please find the final versions of the scripts on the '*final-master-orphan*' branch

## Files
All files used for creating and testing models. Main.py to train models and accuracy.py to test them. Checkout
respective bash scripts for running these files
